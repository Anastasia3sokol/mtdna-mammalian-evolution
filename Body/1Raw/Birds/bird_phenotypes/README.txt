Codes for different phenotypes:

HI - high altitude
DI - divers
FM - long-distance migration
NF - flightless
WI - wintering
AI - outstanding flight abilities

Files with .fasta extensions contain concatenated alignments of 13 mitochondrial genes. Coordinates of gene starts and ends are stored in MT_genes_coordinates_in_alignment.xlsx file.

Files with newick extension contain pylogenetic trees. Tree of all analysed species is stored in best_iqtree_rooted.newick. Subtrees for each of six phenotype groups can be found in files named [penotype code]_inner_nodes.newick.

Files with information about phenotype classification and reconstruction are named [penotype code]_phen_rec.txt
